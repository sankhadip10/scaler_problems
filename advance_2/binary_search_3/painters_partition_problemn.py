Problem Description:
Given 2 integers A and B, and an array of integers C of size N.
Element C[i] represents the length of the ith board. You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1].
There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.

Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.

NOTE:
1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.

Return the answer % 10000003.

Problem Constraints:
1 <= A <= 1000
1 <= B <= 10^6
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= C[i] <= 10^6

Input Format:
The first argument given is the integer A.
The second argument given is the integer B.
The third argument given is the integer array C.

Output Format:
Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board % 10000003.

Example Input:
Input 1:
A = 2
B = 5
C = [1, 10]

Input 2:
A = 10
B = 1
C = [1, 8, 11, 3]

Example Output:
Output 1: 50
Output 2: 11

Example Explanation:
Explanation 1:
Possibility 1: One painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
Possibility 2: Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time taken = max(5, 50) = 50
There are no other distinct ways to paint boards. Answer = 50 % 10000003.

Explanation 2:
Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3,
and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11. Answer = 11 % 10000003.
